Supply Chain Analytics Project

Overview
This project leverages Azure's powerful data services to provide insights into the supply chain process. By using Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Azure Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI, we have developed a scalable data pipeline to analyze and visualize supply chain metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Architecture
The architecture of the solution involves multiple Azure services working together to ingest, process, store, and visualize data. Below is the high-level flow:

Data Ingestion: Azure Data Factory (ADF) is used to extract data from multiple sources (e.g., ERP systems, CSV files, APIs).
Data Storage: The raw data is stored in Azure Data Lake Gen 2, providing a scalable and secure data storage solution.
Data Processing: Azure Databricks is used for data transformation and analytics. We utilized PySpark to clean, enrich, and aggregate the data.
Data Warehousing: The processed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis and querying.
Data Visualization: Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards and reports for end-users to gain actionable insights.

Technologies Used
Azure Data Factory: For orchestrating ETL processes and data pipelines.
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2: For secure and scalable data storage.
Azure Databricks: For data transformation and advanced analytics using PySpark.
Azure Synapse Analytics: For data warehousing and SQL analytics.
Power BI: For data visualization and reporting.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Azure services can be integrated to build a robust supply chain analytics solution. The combination of Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Databricks, Synapse, and Power BI provides a comprehensive platform for data-driven decision-making in supply chain management.
